# odin-tic-tac-toe
TTC Page for The Odin Project

An implementation of (most of) the requirements for TOP's Tic-Tac-Toe. I implemented this following WebDevSimplified's fantastic tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-GkMjUZsmM), and then customized it to my own requirements. I added a game start button, player indicators, color styling, and a few extra features. I still want to revisit this at some point and refactor it more in line with the OOP style layed out in the project template.
